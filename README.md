I am new to this and figuring out how to code and program

Good Afternoon coders,

I am new to this as previously stated. I am going through the steps that GitHub is giving me.
It feels that I am just one of the new monkeys coming out of the lab and just flipping through my lego manual to figure this all out.
Hope this made you laugh!
